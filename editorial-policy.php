                        <li class="list-group-item">You can not pay to have your cafe, shop, restaurant, bar, concept
                            listed on thehuntr.com, or any of our social channels. We do not run or accept paid posts.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">We are passionate about spotlighting the best places to eat and
                            drink and the best things to see and do in Dubai and the UAE. We especially love to support
                            homegrown businesses.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">We do accept invitations to dine, stay, experience or visit.
                            However, we do not then feel obliged to paint a pretty picture of a place. We present it as
                            we see it, and if it is bad – we do not run it on thehuntr.com at all. We also always visit
                            a place incognito, either before or after an accepted invitation, to ensure that the
                            standards are consistent.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"> We do not publish negative reviews. We see it as a waste of time
                            for us, the business, and the community. We send constructive feedback privately if we have
                            a bad experience and we do not run it on these pages or across our social platforms. This
                            means that you can explore thehuntr.com safe in the knowledge that every place listed has
                            our seal of approval.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">To feature on The HUNTR, a place has to be exceptional in either
                            food, drinks, services, or atmosphere, and preferably – it has a combination of all four. We
                            are only including spots that would score a 7/10 minimum as an overall vibe. </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">We do engage in commercial collaborations with like-minded
                            businesses for special projects. The word “like-minded” is the key here: If we do not
                            believe in the brand – we do not say we do. It’s quite simple. And we are quite particular
                            about The HUNTR brand and who we associate with.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">We regularly revisit the places listed within thehuntr.com all year
                            round to ensure the standards are still high. We also regularly update our features with new
                            images, offers, insider tips, and information. If you spot an error or want to report a
                            closure, we would love to hear from you – please contact us at hello@thehuntr.com with the
                            subject link: ‘Error Report/Closure Notice’ and a link to the feature in question.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Our door and ears are always open. If you want to reach out to us
                            about absolutely anything, please do. You can drop our founder an email by clicking here.
